        <p>Leila:</p>
        <p>A person called Evelyn saw a peony parrot with a glowing body on a full moon day, so she followed it into the forest.</p>
        <p>Evelyn:</p>
        <p>Suddenly a light appeared, she subconsciously covered her eyes, wait for her slow mind, peony parrot has disappeared. She looked around and saw a piece of paper appeared on the ground. It said, "Welcome to Leila's world!" Below is a map. She had to continue along the only path, and the next stop was leila's cabin.</p>
        <p>Leila:</p>
        <p>Evelyn looked at the road in front of her and pondered that leila was the same as her best friend's name, it was dark and there were noises in front of her, she was scared but curiosity drove her forward, she walked carefully when a tiger appeared, the tiger was very angry, Evelyn thought she was wearing a red cloak so she took off her cloak and took out the only Dove chocolate she had, the tiger had ever smelt such a delicious. who could refuse chocolate? so the old tiger became Evelyn's friend and together they went forward to leila's cottage</p>
        <p>Evelyn:</p>
        <p>She knocked on the door and a faint voice came out.</p>
            <p>"Who is it?"</p>
            <p>"I'm Evelyn. I was led here by a parrot, and I have a map it left me to prove it."</p>
            <p>The door opened slowly and a woman appeared. She wore a purple robe covered in runes and a big smile.</p>
            <p>"I see. The parrot is my messenger. I told it to bring you here. Please come in."</p>
        <p>Leila:</p>
            <p>leila said slowly, "I am actually a wizard of the Chocolate Kingdom."</p>
            <p>The reason I brought you here is because right now the Chocolate Kingdom is under attack from King Candy's cannonballs, you are the most chocolate loving child in the world and the Kingdom needs you to go to the Cloud Kingdom to find the Wind Spirit Pearl, with the wind boosting the cannonballs will blow back to the Candy Kingdom. I'm sure you can do it.</p>
            <p>Evelyn goes to the Cloud Kingdom with a determined heart</p>
        <p>Evelyn:</p>
        <p>Along the way, Evelyn was helped by many kindhearted people, and finally arrived in the Cloud Kingdom, where she killed dragons, soldiers, and finally took the Wind Spirit Pearl.</p>
        <p>Leila:</p>
        <p>Evelyn brought the wind spirit pearls to the Chocolate Kingdom and with Evelyn's help repelled the invasion of the Candy Kingdom and the Chocolate King was delighted to celebrate for five days. The Chocolate King asked Evelyn what she wanted as a reward.</p>
        <p>Evelyn:</p>
        <p>Evelyn says "I don't want anything. I want peace and love in the world."</p>
        <p>The king shrugged and said, "Well, that's out of my control."</p>
        <p>"All right." Evelyn had to go home.</p>
