        <p>Leila:</p>
        <p>A person called Evelyn saw a peony parrot with a glowing body on a full moon day, so she followed it into the forest.</p>
        <p>Evelyn:</p>
        <p>Suddenly a light appeared, she subconsciously covered her eyes, wait for her slow mind, peony parrot has disappeared. She looked around and saw a piece of paper appeared on the ground. It said, "Welcome to Leila's world!" Below is a map. She had to continue along the only path, and the next stop was leila's cabin.</p>
        <p>Leila:</p>
        <p>Evelyn looked at the road in front of her and pondered that leila was the same as her best friend's name, it was dark and there were noises in front of her, she was scared but curiosity drove her forward, she walked carefully when a tiger appeared, the tiger was very angry, Evelyn thought she was wearing a red cloak so she took off her cloak and took out the only Dove chocolate she had, the tiger had ever smelt such a delicious. who could refuse chocolate? so the old tiger became Evelyn's friend and together they went forward to leila's cottage</p>
